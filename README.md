## ⓘ About Me
I'm an 18 year old developer with experience in **Python**, **Bash**, and a little bit of **HTML**.
I've been interested in computers since I was an 8 year old, and since then I've always been interested in learning something new.

I tried **Linux** for the first time in 2023 as an experiment, and since then I loved it! However, I didn't install it on my main computer until 2024.
The only reason I use **Linux** is because of the customization and the extra fps. I don't really care that much about privacy, but I don't like having Microslop spying on me through my webcam.
